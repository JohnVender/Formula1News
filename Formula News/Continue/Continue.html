              Red Bull’s Max Verstappen prevailed in a tense, strategic battle with McLaren’s Lando Norris to win the
              Spanish Grand Prix.
            </p>
          </div >
          <div class="columnverstappe-2 container-xs">
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              Verstappen’s seventh victory in 10 races this year hinged on a decisive opening phase of the race from the
              Dutchman.
            </p>
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              Verstappen was in the lead by lap three while Norris stayed stuck behind Mercedes’ George Russell for 15
              laps.
            </p>
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              Lewis Hamilton took his first podium finish of the year for Mercedes in third, ahead of Russell, as
              Britons finished second, third and fourth. Charles Leclerc was fifth, leading home Ferrari team-mate
              Carlos Sainz.
            </p>
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              The race underlined the fact that Red Bull have lost the massive advantage they held over the first five
              races of the season, but also that Verstappen is operating at a level of consistent excellence in the
              cockpit and will be tough to beat - not only for the championship, on which he has a stranglehold, but
              also on individual race weekends.
            </p>
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              McLaren have been on Red Bull’s pace since the Miami Grand Prix in early May, and Verstappen has not taken
              a pole position since the Chinese Grand Prix in April.
            </p>
              <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
                Even so, Verstappen has won three of the past five races and consolidated his championship advantage.
              </p>
              <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
                Norris has moved ahead of Leclerc into second place but is 69 points behind Verstappen after 10 of 24
                races.
              </p>
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              &quot;I should have won it,&quot; Norris said. &quot;I got a bad start, as simple as that. The car was
              incredible today, we were for sure the quickest, I just lose it in the beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="verstappens ui text size-textlg">
              &quot;Disappointed but a lot of positives. One negative and that kind of ruined everything. I know that I
              can just work on it for next time.&quot;
            </p>

          <p class="verstappen ui text size-textxl">Verstappen decisive and imperious</p>
          <p class="verstappen_one ui text size-textlg">
            Verstappen grabbed the race by the throat with a brilliant opening few laps at the Circuit de
            Barcelona-Catalunya.
          </p>
          <p class="description ui text size-textlg">
            He made a slightly better start than Norris and was able to get his front wing inside the McLaren on the run
            to the first corner.
          </p>
          <p class="norrisdefended ui text size-textlg">
            Norris defended robustly, even forcing Verstappen on to the grass, but was able to fend off the Red Bull.
          </p>
          <p class="description-1 ui text size-textlg">
            Verstappen passed Norris on the inside as Russell took advantage of their tussle to pass both to grab the
            lead from fourth on the grid.
          </p>
          <p class="description-2 ui text size-textlg">
            Verstappen then passed Russell at the start of lap three in a decisive and committed move around the outside
            of Turn One, while Norris was stuck behind the Mercedes for a further 12 laps. The Dutchman said this phase
            &quot;made the race for him&quot;.
          </p>
          <p class="description-3 ui text size-textlg">
            It forced Norris and McLaren into an off-set strategy, trying to run longer and then come back at Verstappen
            on fresher tyres.
          </p>
          <p class="description-4 ui text size-textlg">
            But it left him too much to do and he had to settle for second behind the Red Bull driver, who yet again
            proved himself the class of the field.
          </p>
          <div class="column">
            <p class="verstappenwas ui text size-textlg">
              Verstappen had a four-second advantage when he made his first stop on lap 17, and McLaren decided to leave
              Norris out, waiting a further seven laps before his stop.
            </p>
            <p class="description-12 ui text size-textlg">
              He had to fight his way back past first the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz and then the Mercedes of Russell and
              Hamilton before closing in on Verstappen.
