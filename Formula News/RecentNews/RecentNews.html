            Piastri held onto second from the start, but managed to force his way past long-time leader Leclerc after the pit stops in a late and aggressive move. From there he had to defend for lap after lap, the Ferrari in his mirrors constantly and the free air up front not helping him pull away. He didn’t put a foot wrong under extreme pressure and emerged from it all with a second hard-fought Grand Prix victory. As for Norris, he made his way forward on the hard tyre from P15 on the grid and was soon in the points. He managed to hold up Perez for one crucial lap that enabled Piastri to get out in front of the Mexican, and pitted very late for the mediums. On that compound, Norris chased down and got past Verstappen on merit, to finish fourth in a very good case of damage limitation from that lowly grid slot.

            “P1! I’m so happy to have won my second Grand Prix. This is the best win of my career. I’m proud of what we did today. I tried at the start of the race to get in front, but once I dropped out of DRS, I just didn't have the pace. After the stop, I saw we were pretty close again, and I felt like we had a little bit of extra grip. I had to go for it because I knew that if I didn't get past at the start of the stint, I was never going to get past. So, I went for a pretty big lunge, but managed to pull it up, and then hung on for dear life for the next 35 laps. It was hard work, but I think that definitely goes down as one of my better races.

            “We’re now leading the World Championship. It’s a massive team effort and everyone at McLaren deserves full credit for the turnaround that’s happened in my 18 months here. The car has improved, but I think they’ve helped me improve as well: 12 months ago, I definitely wasn’t capable of achieving results like this. I’m excited to see what the future holds.”

            "A great result for the team, with a great race from both sides. First of all, congrats to Oscar for another win, he deserves it. I think I had a great race. I got fastest lap and a good number of points from where we were so I’m very happy. We’re the team that gained the most points today, so I think we should be very satisfied with that. It’s the maximum we could have done today, and we’ve taken the lead in the Constructors’ Championship. A job well done by everyone.”
