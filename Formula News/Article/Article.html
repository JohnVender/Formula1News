            Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes unsurprised by 'disastrous' race of 'misery' at Azerbaijan GP
          </p>
          <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
            Lewis Hamilton finished ninth after starting in pit lane in Sunday's race, gaining two places late on thanks to Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez's crash; Hamilton also says Mercedes have been out-developed by their rivals
          </p>
          <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
            Lewis Hamilton says he always expected his Azerbaijan Grand Prix to be "disastrous" after Mercedes' engine penalty, with the seven-time world champion eventually finishing ninth in a frustrating race.
          </p>
          <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
            Hamilton qualified seventh in Baku but was forced to start from the pit lane after Mercedes opted to fit a new engine and then, in contrast to McLaren's Lando Norris, struggled to make ground in the race.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          The Englishman finished behind both Williams cars in ninth, with his points finish only possible thanks to Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez's crash in the battle for third on the penultimate lap.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          "I knew it was going to be a disastrous race as soon as this decision was made last night," said a downbeat Hamilton.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          Hamilton started on the hard tyre before pitting on Lap 13, but while Norris moved from 15th to fourth on race day through a pack of cars, a Mercedes car with less straight-line speed made Hamilton's comeback more difficult.

        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          His comments were really similar those of Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, who said: "We knew it would be a race of misery because it's so difficult to overtake in Baku."
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          "You get close then overheat the tyres and you go backwards, so that's what happened."
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          Mercedes ran the old floor in Baku and will do the same next weekend at the Singapore Grand Prix.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          In the opening practice sessions, Hamilton was happy with the balance of the car but struggled from Saturday onwards.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          "It was pretty good on Friday but I think the others have developed and we haven't in this phase - but we have some stuff coming," he said.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          Since the resumption of F1 after the summer break, Hamilton has finished in eighth, fifth and ninth but remains 23 points in front of Russell in the Drivers' Championship.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          Mercedes won three out of four races before the summer but haven't found that form recently and Wolff hopes a brand-new floor at the United States Grand Prix, which follows Singapore, will improve the performance
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          "We still suffered from the same balance problems we had with the new floor," he said.
        </p>
        <p class="description-4 ui text size-textmd">
          "With Singapore, we have the same one, so we have to race that. From Austin onwards, we will go to a new spec."
